## Key Features of Gadget Heaven

1. Responsive Pages – Includes Home, About Us, Dashboard, Statistics, and 404 pages for smooth navigation.
2. Persistent Cart & Wishlist – Cart and wishlist data are stored in localStorage, retaining data across page reloads.
3. Add to Cart & Wishlist Logic – Adding an item to the cart removes it from the wishlist and vice versa, with counters updating in real-time.
4. Product Details Page – Each product has a dedicated detail page with “Add to Cart” and “Add to Wishlist” options.
5. Automatic Navigation – After adding a product to the cart, users are automatically redirected to Home for continued shopping.
6. Purchase Handling – Purchase button clears cart data, disables further purchases, and redirects users to Home without reload.
7. Real-Time Counters – Shows the number of items in the cart and wishlist dynamically; hides counters when no items are selected.
   9. keleton Loading – Product loading uses skeleton screens to enhance UX during data fetch.
